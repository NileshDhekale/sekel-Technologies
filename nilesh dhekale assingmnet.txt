a: User should be able to add a list with text, number and special characters

Ans : The text Enter User Name should be displayed by default in the text box. When the user starts entering the name, this text should disappear, is a mandatory field, should be validated. It should not allow any numbers and special characters other than space. 
  
	<input type="text name="username" placeholder="Enter User Name pattern="[A-Za-z\s]" required/>


b: User should be able to strike throught the list time 

Ans :
	we can easily do this by using React state. I assume that your items is stored in your component state and in a todo item, you need to store whether it is completed or not ( a boolean value ). 

	const completed = (id) => {
   /* update the state by changing the completed value of the
      clicked todo item */
   this.setState({
      items : this.state.items.map(item => {
         if(item.id === id){
            item.completed = true;
         }
         return item;
      })
   })

}

<List dense={dense}>
  {this.state.items
    .reverse()
    .map(x => (
      <ListItem
        key={x.id}
        button
        // add a unique id
        id={x.id}
        
        // add a strike style depending on the completed property of the todo item
        style={{ textDecoration : x.completed ? 'line-through' : 'none' }} 
        
        // call completed with the id
        onClick={() => completed(x.id)} 

        divider
      >
        <ListItemText primary={listItems(x)} />
        <ListItemSecondaryAction></ListItemSecondaryAction>
      </ListItem>
    ))}
</List> 


C: User should be able to create folder for the todo list to be saved in.

Ans: 
	Yes, users can create folders to organize and save their to-do lists. The ability to create folders is available in many file management systems and productivity tools.

To create a folder for a to-do list, the user can typically navigate to the directory or location where they want the folder to be created. In many applications, this can be done by clicking on a "New Folder" button or selecting "New Folder" from a right-click menu.

Once the folder is created, the user can save their to-do list in the folder by selecting the list and dragging it into the folder or using a "Save As" function to save the list directly to the folder.
